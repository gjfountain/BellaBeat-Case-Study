Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market.

What are some trends in smart device usage?\n2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\n### The Business Task\n\nIdentify trends in how consumers use other smart devices to apply insights to BellaBeat's market strategy.\n\n# Phase 2: Prepare\n\n### What Data are we using?\n\nThe data is a public dataset \"Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data\" made available through Mobious, and found on Kaggle. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits. \n\nThe data was broken down into csv files which were grouped into 2 folders denoting 2 separate 31 day windows. The following files were omitted:\n\n  dailycalories, dailyintensities, dailysteps, dailysleep; for only having data within one of the 31 day timeframes.\n  minutecalories,minuteintensitiesminuteMETS, and minutesteps since the data is also captured in the hourly files.\n\nThis leaves us: daily_activity, hourly_calories, hourly_intensities, hourly_steps, weight, and heartrate_seconds\n\n# Phase 3: Process\n\nWe'll start by installing and loading the packages we'll use\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(\"here\")\nlibrary(\"skimr\")\nlibrary(\"janitor\")\nlibrary(\"plyr\")\nlibrary(\"dplyr\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-16T15:41:14.834490Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-16T15:41:14.836537Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-16T15:41:14.861906Z"},"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Importing Datasets\n\nThe data was renamed to _1 for the first timeframeand _2 for the second timeframe to be able to later combine them.

Due to the low use of features such as weight, sleep readings, and heartrate, Bellabeat could introduce a scale that automatically updates weight from a scale to the app, much like the water bottle they are currently marketing. They coud also look into why a lot of people do not use the sleep functionality of the smart devices.\n\n2. Based off the data that most users are in the lower to middle groups of activity levels. Bellabeat could tailor their ads to people who are lightly active and speak to the benefits of being able to track your activity and immprove upon it such as step/calorie/intensity goals.\n\n3. Finally they would want to look into getting additional data about why people stop using smart devices for health tracking after about 1-2 months. Once they get additional data they could tailor marketing and subscription reminders based off when people would be most likely to re-new the subscription or not. They would also want to market the longevity and benefits of using Bellabeats for a long period. \n","metadata":{}}]}
